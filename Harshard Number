Program to check whether a number is a Harshad number or not (Niven number) is discussed here. Harshad Number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.

code:

a=int(input())
c=a
sum=0
for i in range(1,a):
    n=a%10
    sum=sum+n
    a=a//10
if c%sum==0:
    print("Harshad number")
else:
    print("Not Harshad number")
