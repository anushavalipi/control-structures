The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest to output]

code:

i=int(input('Enter the number of months \n'))
a=0
b=1
count=2
while count<i:
    c=a+b
    a=b
    b=c
    count=count+1
print('The amoeba size is \n',c)
